In Ontario, operating a home-based daycare is regulated by the Ministry of Education and governed by the Child Care and Early Years Act, 2014 (CCEYA). 
## The steps you need to take to legally launch a home-based daycare in Ontario:
1. **Determine if you meet the requirements:** To operate a home-based daycare in Ontario, you must be at least 18 years old, pass a criminal reference check, and have a home that meets safety and zoning requirements.
2. **Attend an orientation session:** Contact your local municipal licensing office to find out when the next orientation session for home-based daycare providers will be held. You will be required to attend this session, which provides information about the regulations, safety requirements, and other important aspects of operating a home-based daycare.
3. **Obtain a license:** After attending the orientation session, you will need to apply for a license to operate a home-based daycare. The licensing process involves submitting an application, providing references, and having your home inspected to ensure it meets safety requirements. You will also need to provide documentation, including proof of insurance and first aid certification.
4. **Complete training:** Before you can receive a license to operate a home-based daycare, you will need to complete an approved training course in early childhood education.
5. **Open your daycare:** Once you have received your license, you can start operating your home-based daycare. It is important to adhere to all regulations and safety requirements, including maintaining appropriate ratios of children to caregivers, keeping accurate records, and ensuring that your home is safe and clean.
It's worth noting that the process of opening a home-based daycare may vary depending on your specific location within Ontario. It's always a good idea to check with your local municipal licensing office to ensure that you are following the correct procedures.
